    <ul>
      <li>Include a button that, when clicked will change the time on the clock.</li>
      <li>Use a CSS pre-processor. (Either Sass, Less, or something else of your choice).</li>
      <li>Use Browserify to combine at least 2 javascript files into a single one that is loaded on the page.</li>
